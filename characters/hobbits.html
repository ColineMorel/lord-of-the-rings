     <td><p>Frodo Baggins of The Shire serves as the primary protagonist to The Lord of The Rings. Indeed, he will inherit the Ring of Power from his uncle, Bilbo.</p>
       <p>Eventhough he was only set out to bring the Ring to Rivendell, at the age of 33, he will enroll in the Fellowship of the Ring as the Ringbearer and will carry it until it's destruction in the fire of Mount Doom. </p>
       <p>Oddly enough, as a Hobbit, he is particularly clever and showed a lot of resilience to the evil of the Ring, even though in the end he will surrender and almost die because of it.</p>
       <p>In the movie trilogy, this character is embodied by Elijah Woods.</p></td>

       <p>He is an adventurous and clever Hobbit, a Baggins, and his story is described in more details in <em>The Hobbit.</em></p>
       <p>After giving the Ring to Frodo, he will age quickly and most likely die during his last journey to the Immortal Lands.</p>
