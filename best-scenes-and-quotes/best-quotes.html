 <p class="best-quotes">It all began with the forging of the Great Rings. Three were given to  the Elves; immortal, wisest and fairest of all beings. Seven, to the  Dwarf Lords, great miners and craftsmen of the mountain halls. And nine,  nine rings were gifted to the race of Men, who above all else desire  power. For within these rings was bound the strength and the will to  govern over each race. But they were all of them deceived, for another  ring was made. In the land of Mordor, in the fires of Mount Doom, the  Dark Lord Sauron forged in secret, a master ring, to control all others.  And into this ring he poured all his cruelty, his malice and his will  to dominate all life. One ring to rule them all. One by one, the free  peoples of Middle Earth fell to the power of the Ring. But there were  some who resisted. A last alliance of men and elves marched against the  armies of Mordor, and on the very slopes of Mount Doom, they fought for  the freedom of Middle-Earth. Victory was near, but the power of the ring  could not be undone. It was in this moment, when all hope had faded,  that Isildur, son of the king, took up his father's sword. And Sauron,  enemy of the free peoples of Middle-Earth, was defeated. The Ring passed  to Isildur, who had this one chance to destroy evil forever, but the  hearts of men are easily corrupted. And the ring of power has a will of  its own. It betrayed Isildur, to his death. And some things that should  not have been forgotten were lost. History became legend. Legend became  myth. And for two and a half thousand years, the ring passed out of all  knowledge. Until, when chance came, the ring ensnared a new bearer. The  ring came to the creature Gollum, who took it deep into the tunnels  under the Misty Mountains, and there it consumed him. The ring gave to  Gollum unnatural long life. For five hundred years it poisoned his mind;  and in the gloom of Gollum's cave, it waited. Darkness crept back into  the forests of the world. Rumor grew of a shadow in the East, whispers  of a nameless fear, and the Ring of Power perceived. Its time had now  come. It abandoned Gollum. But then something happened that the Ring did  not intend. It was picked up by the most unlikely creature imaginable. A  hobbit, Bilbo Baggins, of the Shire. For the time will soon come when  hobbits will shape the fortunes of all...&quot;</p><h3><strong>Boromir</strong></h3>

  <h3>Gandalf</h3>
  <p class="best-quotes">"Pity? It was pity that stayed Bilbo's hand. Many that live deserve death. Some that die deserve life. Can you give it to them, Frodo? Do not be too eager to deal out death in judgment. Even the very wise cannot see all ends. My heart tells me that Gollum has some part to play yet, for good or ill before this is over. The pity of Bilbo may rule the fate of many." </p>
<h3>Samwise Gamgee</h3>
<p class="best-quotes"> "I know. It's all wrong. By rights we shouldn't even be here. But we are. It's like in the great stories, Mr. Frodo. The ones that really mattered. Full of darkness and danger, they were. And sometimes you didn't want to know the end. Because how could the end be happy? How could the world go back to the way it was when so much bad had happened? But in the end, it's only a passing thing, this shadow. Even darkness must pass. A new day will come. And when the sun shines it will shine out the clearer. Those were the stories that stayed with you. That meant something, even if you were too small to understand why. But I think, Mr. Frodo, I do understand. I know now. Folk in those stories had lots of chances of turning back, only they didn't. They kept going. Because they were holding on to something."</p>
<h3>Eowyn</h3>
<p class="best-quotes">(Aragorn: What do you fear Milady?) "A cage. To stay behind bars until use and old age accept them and all chance of valor has gone beyond recall or desire." </p>
<h3>Aragorn</h3>
<p class="best-quotes">"Hold your ground, hold your ground! Sons of Gondor, of Rohan, my brothers! I see in your eyes the same fear that would take the heart of me. A day may come when the courage of men fails, when we forsake our friends and break all bonds of fellowship, but it is not this day. An hour of woes and shattered shields, when the age of men comes crashing down! But it is not this day! This day we fight! By all that you hold dear on this good Earth, I bid you stand, Men of the West!"</p>
